# covid-app-ios

## what?
A simple app to get the newest (and official) data regarding COVID-19 in Brazil, using https://covid19api.com/.

## why?
Ok, it may sounds stupid for an experienced iOS developer. But for an Android dev, newbie in Apple stuff, it's a great way to get a better understanding of XCode, iOS design patterns, app architecture and so on.
